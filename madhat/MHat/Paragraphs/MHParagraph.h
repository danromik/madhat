// as the basis for their own typesetting, and set the depth and height field to the correct values

The postParagraphSpacing is ignored, but maybe in the future it would be nice (that is, a bit more logical and potentially more robust) to have a setup where each paragraph owns the bottom half of the vertical kern above it, and the bottom half of the vertical kern below it.
