⌘header⟪Comments⟫

You can insert comments in your code by using the comment symbol 【％】. Any text that appears in a line of code following the comment symbol is not processed by ⌘madhat logo．. 

Inserting a comment also suppresses the effect of the newline character at the end of the line containing the comment. So, the paragraph of code 【+Hello, ％ a comment
world】

will typeset as:

Hello, ％ a comment
world
