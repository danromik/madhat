⌘header⟪Typing mathematics⟫

⌘subheader⟪Math mode⟫

⌘madhat logo． makes it easy to typeset mathematical expressions by entering ⌘bold⟪math mode⟫. This is done using the em-hat, or ⌘bold⟪math shift⟫, symbol 【M̂】. If your expression is part of an ordinary text paragraph (in which case we refer to it as ⌘bold⟪inline math⟫), the syntax for inserting such an expression in your text is 【+⁓some text content... ⁓M̂⟪⁓your mathematical content⁓⟫ ⁓...more text content⁓】

Alternatively, the mathematical content can be shown in its own space separated vertically from the surrounding text, known as a ⌘bold⟪math display⟫. The syntax for this is 〖+⁓your mathematical content⁓〗

See also the help page on ⌘intralink⟪Paragraphs；paragraphs⟫.

A keyboard shortcut to enter math mode is to type the dollar sign `$'. See the help page on ⌘intralink⟪List of key substitutions；key substitutions⟫.

⌘madhat logo． supports many additional constructs in the vocabulary of mathematical formulas. Here is a complete list of the supported mathematical typesetting features:

⌘subheader⟪Automatic substitutions⟫

Just like in ⌘intralink⟪Typing text；text mode⟫, the math mode parser performs some automatic substitutions to simplify entering common symbols. Here is the list of implemented substitutions:

⌘begin list．

* 〖-〗  (a hyphen) is replaced by the symbol "M̂⟪-⟫", the proper Unicode symbol for a minus sign

* 〖*〗  (a single asterisk) is replaced by the "times" symbol "M̂⟪*⟫"

* 〖**〗  (two successive asterisks) are replaced by by "M̂⟪**⟫", the dot symbol

* 〖***〗  (three successive asterisks) are replaced by by "M̂⟪***⟫", the star or convolution operator

* 〖<=〗   is replaced with the "less than or equal" symbol "M̂⟪<=⟫"

* 〖>=〗   is replaced with the "greater than or equal" symbol "M̂⟪>=⟫"

* 〖/=〗   is replaced with the "not equal" symbol "M̂⟪/=⟫"

* 〖+-〗   is replaced with the "plus or minus" symbol "M̂⟪+-⟫"

* 〖-+〗   is replaced with the "minus or plus" symbol "M̂⟪-+⟫"

* 〖...〗   (three successive dots) is replaced by the ellipsis symbol "M̂⟪...⟫"

* 〖||〗   (two successive vertical bars) are replaced by the double vertical bar symbol "M̂⟪||⟫" (which, like the single vertical bar symbol, is interpreted by ⌘madhat logo． as a type of ⌘intralink⟪Brackets；bracket⟫)

* 〖'〗   (an apostrophe) is replaced with the prime symbol "M̂⟪'⟫", the correct Unicode symbol for prime or derivative notation

⌘subheader⟪Including text inside a mathematical expression⟫

To include ordinary text from inside math mode, you need to  leave math mode temporarily and re-enter text mode. With an inline math expression, you can simply close out the math mode block, which returns you to text mode typing. Within a math display, this is done using the ⌘bold⟪text shift⟫ symbol 〖T̂〗. The syntax for this is 〖+⁓some math content... ⁓T̂⟪⁓your text⁓⟫ ⁓…more math content⁓〗

⌘subheader⟪Examples⟫

The code paragraph〖+
tau = beta (t-vx/c^2), ⌘newline．
xi = beta (x-vt), ⌘newline．
eta = y, ⌘newline．
zeta = z〗

typesets as

M̂: 
tau = beta (t-vx/c^2), ⌘newline．
xi = beta (x-vt), ⌘newline．
eta = y, ⌘newline．
zeta = z
