⌘paragraph header⟪A note about code snippets.⟫ Throughout the guide, you will find many examples of code in the MadHat language. These code snippets are displayed in the default ⌘intralink⟪Themes and the themes editor；syntax highlighting theme⟫ of the MadHat code editor. For example, the code snippet 【+ "In ⌘italic⟪that⟫ direction," the Cat said, waving its right paw round, "lives a Hatter: and in ⌘italic⟪that⟫ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad."】

displays a ⌘intralink⟪Paragraphs；paragraph⟫ of code parsed in the default mode for entering code, known as ⌘intralink⟪Typing text；text mode⟫, as it would appear when entered in the code editor. Similarly, the snippet〖+a = m^2-n^2 ⌘newline．
b = 2mn ⌘newline．
c = m^2 + n^2〗

shows a paragraph parsed in ⌘intralink⟪Typing mathematics；math mode⟫.
