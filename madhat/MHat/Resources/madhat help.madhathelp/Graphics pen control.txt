⌘header⟪Graphics pen control commands⟫

The ⌘madhat logo． graphics environment supports a "pen drawing" model, also known as ⌘hyperlink⟪https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics；turtle graphics⟫. In this model, you give drawing commands to a virtual pen that has a position and a direction. You can tell the pen to move forward back, to rotate to the left or right, etc.

Pen graphics commands are classified into pen ⌘italic⟪drawing⟫ commands, described on this page, and a separate class of ⌘intralink⟪Graphics pen control；pen control commands⟫ described on a separate help page.
