⌘header⟪Slide transitions⟫

Adding slide transitions to a page is as simple as including one of the slide transition commands below at the appropriate places in your content, with optional attributes to customize the transition.

⌘begin list．

* 【⌘pause．】

Marks a slide transition point in a page. User action is needed to proceed to the next slide.

％ this functionality is currently disabled:
％* 【⌘pause⟪⁓delay⁓⟫】
％
％Marks a slide transition point in a page. The transition to the next slide will happen automatically after the specified delay, in seconds, when in ⌘intralink⟪Slides；auto-present mode⟫.

⌘end list．

The page will automatically calculate how many slides it has based on the number of slide transitions you included (unless you also included ⌘intralink⟪Slide fragments；slide fragments⟫, which could affect the calculation). For example, if there are M̂⟪4⟫ 【⌘pause】 commands, the page will have 5 slides (or more, with slide fragments).
