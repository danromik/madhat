//  a container for a SKTexture that stores a bit of additional useful information relevant to rendered glyphs
//  (This would make more sense as a subclass of SKTexture rather than a container, but I couldn't make that work because the +textureWithImage: constructor method of SKTexture returns an SKTexture object even if it is called on a subclass. Looks like a bug, the documentation says this method should return an instancetype type.)
